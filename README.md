# Work Day Scheduler
![daily planner](assets/images/planner.png)

## Description

This project is a simple calendar application that allows users to save information for each hour of the day.

The motivation for this project was to enable people with busy schedules to add important tasks and events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.

Work Day Scheduler solves the following problem: 
* Being overwhelmed by your to-do lists.
* Having an unorganised day.
* Forgetting to complete certain tasks.
* Missing appointments you forgot about.

It solves these problems by allowing you to allocate a specific time for each task or event. Blocking off specific hours for specific things is known as time-blocking and is an excellent method for productivy and organisation. 

Building this project helped me learn more about:
* Day.js library
* jQuery
* Event Listeners and Event Handling
* Saving data to local storage
* Loading data from local storage
* Removing data from local storage
* DOM Manipulation
* Conditional Logic
* Looping and iteration
* Bootstrap 
* CSS
* Class and ID selectors
* Debugging
